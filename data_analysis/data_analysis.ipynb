    "# Construct integrated data matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "This example analytical workflow integrates data from different experiments, sample types, and analytical methods. The final output of this workflow generates a unified fold-change matrix for all metabolites identified. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example workflow is created using the common biological sample types in microbiome studies (e.g., feces, serum, urine). For bacterial experiments, users can use the same workflow, except for 1) replacing `sample_type` with `media_type` by specifying the type of media used for culturing bacteria, and 2) specifying in the `experiment_type` column with `bacteria`. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the sample database and MS-DIAL analysis data files from all experiments are parsed and integrated into a single data matrix of raw ion counts across the three analytical methods (referred to as \"modes\" below). \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, a shared set of robustly detected internal standards among different experiments are used to normalize within and across experiments to account for intra- and inter-experimental variations in instrumental sensitivity. Specifically, the raw ion count from each metabolite is normalized to the sum of internal standards specific to each experiment (e.g., mono-colonization) and sample type (e.g., serum). \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the fold change matrix is generated by calculating the relative fold change between metabolite ion counts detected in colonized mice vs. germ-free controls for each experiment and sample type. A separate metadata file is also generated to provide details on properties associated with each sample run in each mode.\n",
